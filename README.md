## Summary
I am a responsible and dedicated college student with an excellent work ethic. I've spent many years working with Planned Parenthood to teach sex education, phone bank for the Georgia primaries, and coordinated rallies and marches. I'm well versed in working with the LGBTQ+ and Autistic communities. During my gap year I assisted in a qualitative research study documenting LGBTQ+ resilience during COVID-19. I have many computer skills such as Excel and Qlik Sense, along with a strong grasp on data analytics and visualization.
